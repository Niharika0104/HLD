CAP(Consistency Availabiliy Partion Tolerance)
Consistency means that for every request corresponds to a most recent write.
Availabity means that for every request we get a response.   
Partition Tolerance refers to a situation where the system is up and running even when there is occurence of network partion among the nodes.


Partion Tolerance is a common scenario in distributed system.
All three C,A and P cannot be achieved simultaneously.The reason for that is we want the system to be consistent and also be available while ensuring 
that system is partion tolerant.Assume that we have A,B and C nodes.B does some computation and this should be replicated across the other nodes
for that we need a communcation between them.However,due to network partition the communcation between the nodes is lost and we are unable to 
replicate the data across all the nodes,hence consistency cannot be achieved.
Therefore,C,A and P are not possible to implement in a system.
