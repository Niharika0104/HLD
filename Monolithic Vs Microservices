There are two types of architectures.They are monolithic and microservices.

1.Monolithic:Its is a legacy way of designing systems.In this the entire code of the system is put in the single 
folder.
There are instances where the code can become tightly coupled because of this.

Disadvantages:
1.This can lead to a tightly coupled architecture.
2.Scalibility becomes difficult as the code is tightly coupled and a single change in line can cause re-deployment 
of the entire application.
3.CI jobs may take a lof of time.It would also take a lot of time to load the code into our IDE's.

Microservices:
It's all about breaking an entire system into different parts (these are referred to as services) and these will 
communicate with each other if required to get the job done.Now these services can be scaled and deployed 
indivually.These leads to a loosely coupled architecture.
