Monolithic Architecture:
Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where the entire codebase of a system resides in a single repository or folder. This can lead to tight coupling between different modules or components.

Disadvantages:

Tightly Coupled Architecture: Changes in one part of the code can affect other parts due to dependencies.
Scalability Challenges: Scaling components independently is difficult, often requiring redeployment of the entire 
application.
Continuous Integration (CI) and Development Issues: CI jobs can be time-consuming, and loading the entire 
codebase into IDEs can be cumbersome.
Microservices Architecture:
Microservices architecture involves breaking down a system into smaller, independent services that communicate
with each other as needed. This promotes a loosely coupled architecture.

Disadvantages:

Potential for Tight Coupling: Poorly designed microservices can still result in dependencies and tight coupling.
Monitoring Complexity: When changes in one service affect others, identifying the source of issues can be challenging.
Transaction Management: Each microservice may have its own database, complicating transaction management and 
rollback procedures.
Phases of Microservices Architecture:
Decomposing: Based on business logic or subdomains (Domain-Driven Design - DDD).
Database Strategy: Each service can have its own database or share a common database.
Communication: Services communicate via APIs, events, websockets, or other protocols.
Integration: API gateways facilitate integration and manage interactions between services.
Observability: Implementing tools for monitoring and observing the performance of services.
Continuous Monitoring: Constantly monitor services to ensure performance and reliability.
