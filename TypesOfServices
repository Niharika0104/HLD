Types of Services:
Service Types: Critical for understanding how various patterns are implemented.

Data Service: Connects to a data source within the system, not limited to databases.
Business Service/Business Process Service: A higher abstraction that builds on data services, often defined by business domains.
Translation Service: Encapsulates third-party operations under your own facade.
Edge Service: Serves data to users and external systems, including web and mobile devices.This is the actual one that is exposed.
Cloud-Hosted vs. Cloud-Native:
Cloud-Hosted Application:

This refers to traditional applications that have been moved or deployed to the cloud. For example, 
if you take an existing backend and deploy it on an EC2 instance, it’s a cloud-hosted application.
It benefits from the cloud’s infrastructure, such as scalability and availability, 
but it may not be designed to fully take advantage of cloud-native features.
Cloud-Native Application:

A cloud-native application is designed from the ground up to operate in a cloud environment.
It is built with cloud principles like microservices, containers, serverless architectures, and CI/CD pipelines in mind. 
Cloud-native applications are inherently scalable, resilient, and optimized for dynamic cloud environments.
